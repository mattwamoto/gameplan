Gameplan is a work communication tool for teams who mostly work remote and prefer having meaningful discussions in an async format. We built it for ourselves because we were finding it difficult to keep track of so many conversations in our chat tool. Chat forces you to be online all the time and doesn't really have any concept of threaded discussions. Gameplan allows you to categorize your discussions around projects and teams. It also doubles up as your team's knowledge archive. You can surface important information and conclusions from your discussions into the readme's of your projects and teams.

## Features
- Organize discussions into projects which in turn are part of a team üóÑ
- Surface important information for your project and team in the Readme üìù
- Simple layout that optimizes readability of discussions ü§ì
- Customize your Team and Project with emojis üíÖüèª
- People directory with each person's profile page üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
- Set cover image, profile photo, short bio and a "About me" section ü¶πüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Powerful search capabilities to find older discussions üîç
- A common discussions feed that shows discussions from across projects and teams üìö
- Delightful user-experience in overall usage ‚ú®

1. Run the following commands:
    ```sh
    bench new-site gameplan.test
    bench get-app https://github.com/mattwamoto/gameplan.git
    bench --site gameplan.test install-app gameplan
    bench --site gameplan.test add-to-hosts
    bench --site gameplan.test browse --user Administrator
    ```
 1. Now, open a new terminal session and cd into `frappe-bench/apps/gameplan`, and run the following commands:
    ```
    yarn
    yarn dev
    ```
 1. Now, you can access the site on vite dev server at `http://gameplan.test:8080`
